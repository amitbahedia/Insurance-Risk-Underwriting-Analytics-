🛡️ Insurance Risk & Underwriting Analytics Challenge
Organized by Databuzz Ltd (https://www.databuzzltd.com)

📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Insurance Risk & Underwriting Analytics Challenge organized by Databuzz.

The objective was to analyze an insurance portfolio from a risk and underwriting perspective, identify profitability drivers, and design an interactive Power BI solution that enables multi-level analysis, secure access control, and executive-ready insights.

The solution focuses on:

Portfolio health and profitability assessment

Risk concentration analysis

Claims frequency and severity evaluation

Underwriting pressure identification

Region-based access control using Row-Level Security

Multi-level navigation using Drill-Through and Drill-Down
